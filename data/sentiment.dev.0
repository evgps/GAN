i hereby demand , and will do so officially tomorrow , that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi / doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration !
rt HDL : it is emotional day being back at HDL in celebration of our dear friend colin !
he was a beautiful child who we will all 
the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they  re looking at the rest of the world .
oh  great !
... and why hasn  t the podesta brother been charged and arrested , like others , after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm ?
is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington , d . c . ?
what ever happened to the server , at the center of so much corruption , that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging ( except in the case of democrats ) fbi ?
they broke into homes & offices early in the morning , but were afraid to take the server ?
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world , they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party .
don  t worry about dems fisa abuse , missing emails or fraudulent dossier !
... in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails , got $ 145,000 , 000 while secretary of state , paid mccabes wife $ 700,000 ( and got off the fbi hook along with terry m ) and so much more .
republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam .
... at what point does this soon to be $ 20,000 , 000 witch hunt , composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years , stop !
they have found no collussion with russia , no obstruction , but they aren  t looking at the corruption ...
things are really getting ridiculous .
the failing and crooked ( but not as crooked as hillary clinton ) HDL has done a long & boring story indicating that the world  s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the world !
if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign , that is a really big deal .
only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee ( also , senate judiciary ) is asking for can give the conclusive answers .
drain the swamp !
great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house .
melania is feeling and doing really well .
thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes !

early reports not looking good .
god bless all !
reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted , for political purposes , into my campaign for president .
it took place very early on , and long before the phony russia hoax became a  hot  fake news story .
if true - all time biggest political scandal !
why isn  t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $ 700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia , led by clinton best friend terry m ( under fbi investigation that they killed ) gave to mccabe  s wife in her run for office ?
then dropped case on clinton !
fake news media had me calling immigrants , or illegal immigrants ,  animals .  wrong !
they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories .
i referred to ms 13 gang members as  animals ,  a big difference - and so true .
fake news got it purposely wrong , as usual !
 apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign .
this has never been done before and by any means necessary , they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn  t commit .  david asman HDL HDL really bad stuff !

without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care .
putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable  senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day !
despite the disgusting , illegal and unwarranted witch hunt , we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u . s . history - by far !
sorry to the fake news media and  haters ,  but that  s the way it is !
wow , word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi  spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant .  andrew mccarthy says ,  there  s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign .  if so , this is bigger than watergate !

congratulations america , we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history ... and there is still no collusion and no obstruction .
the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money !
gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia .
she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately .
we need her to keep our great country safe !
... and voted against the massive tax cut bill .
he  s also weak on borders and crime .
sadly , our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr . lou barletta will win !
lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent , bob casey , has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time .
he votes along the nancy pelosi , elizabeth warren lines , loves sanctuary cities , bad and expensive healthcare ...
today , it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the HDL !
house votes today on choice / mission act .
who will stand with our great vets , caregivers , and veterans service organizations ?
must get choice passed by memorial day !

the u . s . has very little to give , because it has given so much over the years .
china has much to give !
... we have not seen china  s demands yet , which should be few in that previous u . s .
administrations have done so poorly in negotiating .
china has seen our demands .
there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe , the meetings ...
the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china .
nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal .
our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china ...
congratulations to deb fischer .
the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box !
congratulations to lou barletta of pennsylvania .
he will be a great senator and will represent his people well - like they haven  t been represented in many years .
lou is a friend of mine and a special guy , he will very much help make america great again !
thank you to the washington examiner and HDL on the great article - on winning !

can you believe that with all of the made up , unsourced stories i get from the fake news media , together with the $ 10,000 , 000 russian witch hunt ( there is no collusion ) , i now have my best poll numbers in a year .
much of the media may be corrupt , but the people truly get it !
trade negotiations are continuing with china .

changes to our thought process on terror must be made .
remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place .
they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary .
now , that will not happen !
china and the united states are working well together on trade , but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china , for so many years , that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries .
but be cool , it will all work out !
president xi of china , and i , are working together to give massive chinese phone company , zte , a way to get back into business , fast .
too many jobs in china lost .

happy mother  s day ! ! !

iran  s military budget is up more than 40 % since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reached ... just another indicator that it was all a big lie .
but not anymore !
north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month , ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th .
thank you , a very smart and gracious gesture !
why doesn  t the fake news media state that the trump administration  s anti-trust division has been , and is , opposed to the at & t purchase of time warner in a currently ongoing trial .
such a disgrace in reporting !
big week next week when the american embassy in israel will be moved to jerusalem .

why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt ?
take away credentials ?
the republican party had a great night .
tremendous voter energy and excitement , and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november .

marsha blackburn is a rock-ribbed conservativ 
here  s a great stat - since january 2017 , the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million .
the american people are finally back to work !
mexico , whose laws on immigration are very tough , must stop people from going through mexico and into the u . s . we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement .
our country cannot accept what is happening !
also , we must get wall funding fast .
despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border being so bad and one sided , i have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country .
it is a disgrace .
we are the only country in the world so naive !
hard to believe obstructionists may vote against mike pompeo for secretary of state .
the dems will not approve hundreds of good people , including the ambassador to germany .
they are maxing out the time on approval process for all , never happened before .
need more republicans !
thank you to the incredible law enforcement officers from the palm beach county sheriff  s office .
they keep us safe and are very cool about it !
kim strassel of the wsj just said , after reviewing the dumb comey memos ,  you got to ask , what was the purpose of the special counsel ?
there  s no there there .  dan henninger of the wsj said memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought !
funny how all of the pundits that couldn  t come close to making a deal on north korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal !
a complete witch hunt !
 i can die happy now with trump job performance ,  stated mary matalin .
 a great overall president , stunning !  thank you mary .
... we are a long way from conclusion on north korea , maybe things will work out , and maybe they won  t - only time will tell ... but the work i am doing now should have been done a long time ago !
sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake news nbc just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with north korea , and they have given up nothing .
wow , we haven  t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization ( so great for world ) , site closure , & no more testing !
 gop lawmakers asking sessions to investigate comey and hillary clinton .  HDL good luck with that request !
 at least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information .  wall street journal
rt HDL : the same can be said of the " collusion " stuff .
the washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as  mr .
magoo  and rod rosenstein as  mr .
peepers .  this is  according to people with whom the president has spoken .  there are no such people and don  t know these characters ... just more fake & disgusting news to create ill will !
james comey  s memos are classified , i did not declassify them .
they belong to our government !
therefore , he broke the law !
additionally , he totally made up many of the things he said i said , and he is already a proven liar and leaker .
where are memos on clinton , lynch & others ?
sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson .
his trials and tribulations were great , his life complex and controversial .
others have looked at this over the years , most thought it would be done , but yes , i am considering a full pardon !
so funny , the democrats have sued the republicans for winning .
now he r  s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material , including servers and emails !
heading to the southern white house to watch the funeral service of barbara bush .
first lady melania has arrived in houston to pay our respects .
will be a beautiful day !
today , my thoughts and prayers are with the entire bush family .
in memory of first lady barbara bush , there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the center hall of the HDL .
fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in key west , florida .

a message from kim jong un :  north korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles .  also will  shut down a nuclear test site in the country  s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests .  progress being made for all !
james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council ?
therefore , the special council was established based on an illegal act ?
really , does everybody know what that means ?
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats .
this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi , the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails .
north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site .
this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress !
look forward to our summit .
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats .
this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi , the wendy wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails .
can you believe that despite 93 % bad stories from the fake news media ( should be getting good stories ) , today we had just about our highest poll numbers , including those on election day ?
the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press .
make america great again !
looks like opec is at it again .
with record amounts of oil all over the place , including the fully loaded ships at sea , oil prices are artificially very high !
no good and will not be accepted !
nancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the republicans ... got not one democrat vote !
here  s a choice .
they want to end them and raise your taxes substantially .
republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts !
i have agreed to be the commencement speaker at our great naval academy on may 25th in annapolis , maryland .
looking forward to being there .
so general michael flynn  s life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book ( that should never have been written ) .
is that really the way life in america is supposed to work ?
i don  t think so !
james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction .
also , he leaked classified information .
will the witch hunt continue ?
james comey just threw andrew mccabe  under the bus .  inspector general  s report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them !
getting a little ( lot ) of their own medicine ?
sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states , making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed .
we are doing a great job of law enforcement , but things such as this make safety in america difficult !
my thoughts , prayers and condolences are with the families , friends and colleagues of the two HDL deputies ( heroes ) who lost their lives in the line of duty today .
mike pompeo is outstanding .
first in his class at west point .
a top student at harvard law school .
a success at whatever he has done .
we need the senate to approve mike asap .
he will be a great secretary of state !
... hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors , judges and the people who make washington work are approved .
the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country !
democrats are obstructing good ( hopefully great ) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government , hence , the american people .
they are  slow walking  all of my nominations - hundreds of people .
at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals !
HDL is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her .
great on the military , border security and crime .
loves and works hard for the people of tennessee .
she has my full endorsement and i will be there to campaign with her !
thank you #jiatfsouth , HDL , HDL and HDL .
keep up the great work !
just arrived HDL !
heading to a briefing with the joint interagency task force south , northcom and southcom .
governor jerry brown announced he will deploy  up to 400 national guard troops  to do nothing .
the crime rate in california is high enough , and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown  s charade .
we need border security and action , not words !
thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california's illegal and unconstitutional ' sanctuary ' policies .
california's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities , putting all americans at risk .
great meeting with prime minister abe of japan , who has just left florida .

comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her ( lied in congress to senator g ) , then based his decisions on her poll numbers .
disgruntled , he , mccabe , and the others , committed many crimes !
just hit 50 % in the rasmussen poll , much higher than president obama at same point .
with all of the phony stories and fake news , it  s hard to believe !
thank you america , we are doing great things .
slippery james comey , a man who always ends up badly and out of whack ( he is not smart !
) , will go down as the worst fbi director in history , by far !
attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past .
i have many ( too many ! )
lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices , and even homes , are going to be raided with everything , including their phones and computers , taken .
all lawyers are deflated and concerned !
i never asked comey for personal loyalty .
i hardly even knew this guy .
just another of his many lies .
his  memos  are self serving and fake !
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out , with such precision , that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term  mission accomplished .  i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term , it should be brought back .
comey throws ag lynch  under the bus !  why can  t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch ?
was she promised a supreme court seat , or ag , in order to lay off hillary .
no golf and grandkids talk ( give us all a break ) !
the big questions in comey  s badly reviewed book aren  t answered like , how come he gave up classified information ( jail ) , why did he lie to congress ( jail ) , why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi ( why didn  t they take it ) , why the phony memos , mccabe  s $ 700,000 & more ?
unbelievably , james comey states that polls , where crooked hillary was leading , were a factor in the handling ( stupidly ) of the clinton email probe .
in other words , he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win , and he wanted a job .

we are bringing back our factories , we are bringing back our jobs , and we are bringing back those four beautiful words : made in the usa !
... untruthful slime ball who was , as time has proven , a terrible director of the fbi .
his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case , and the events surrounding it , will go down as one of the worst  botch jobs  of history .
it was my great honor to fire james comey !
james comey is a proven leaker & liar .
virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was , in fact , fired .
he leaked classified information , for which he should be prosecuted .
he lied to congress under oath .
he is a weak and ...
tremendous pressure is building , like never before , for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities .
started the wall in san diego , where the people were pushing really hard to get it .
they will soon be protected !

we are with you paul !
much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake & corrupt russia investigation , headed up by the all democrat loyalists , or people that worked for obama .
mueller is most conflicted of all ( except rosenstein who signed fisa & comey letter ) .
no collusion , so they go crazy !
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been , and that includes the cold war .
there is no reason for this .
russia needs us to help with their economy , something that would be very easy to do , and we need all nations to work together .
stop the arms race ?
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria .
get ready russia , because they will be coming , nice and new and  smart !  you shouldn  t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it !
... doing things that nobody thought possible , despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation , which takes tremendous time and focus .
no collusion or obstruction ( other than i fight back ) , so now they do the unthinkable , and raid a lawyers office for information !
so much fake news about what is going on in the white house .
very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china , the coming north korea meeting and , of course , the vicious gas attack in syria .

china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do .
taxes will become reciprocal & a deal will be made on intellectual property .

we are not in a trade war with china , that war was lost many years ago by the foolish , or incompetent , people who represented the u . s . now we have a trade deficit of $ 500 billion a year , with intellectual property theft of another $ 300 billion .
we cannot let this continue !
our border laws are very weak while those of mexico & canada are very strong .
congress must change these obama era , and other , laws now !
the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked ... crime !
we will be taking strong action today .

i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy .
amazon should pay these costs ( plus ) and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer .
many billions of dollars .
p . o .
leaders don  t have a clue ( or do they ?
thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling .
just hit 50 % , which is higher than cheatin  obama at the same time in his administration .
check out the fact that you can  t get a job at ratings challenged HDL unless you state that you are totally anti-trump ?
little jeff zuker , whose job is in jeopardy , is not having much fun lately .
they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting !
the big caravan of people from honduras , now coming across mexico and heading to our  weak laws  border , had better be stopped before it gets there .
cash cow nafta is in play , as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen .
congress must act now !
the fake news networks , those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda , are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast .
the  fakers  at cnn , nbc , abc & cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction !
 president trump's approval rate among likely u . s . voters hit 50 percent on monday , which puts him higher than former president barack obama's score at the same point into his first term , according to a new poll .  via : HDL HDL URL
39 % of my nominations , including diplomats to foreign lands , have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay .
at this rate , it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working .
never happened before .
honduras , mexico and many other countries that the u . s . is very generous to , sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies .
caravans are heading here .
must pass tough laws and build the wall .
democrats allow open borders , drugs and crime !
as ridiculous as it sounds , the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from .
a whole big wasted procedure must take place .
mexico & canada have tough immigration laws , whereas ours are an obama joke .
 president donald j . trump proclaims april 2 , 2018 , world autism awareness day  URL
an honor to host the annual HDL easter egg roll !
so sad that the department of  justice  and the fbi are slow walking , or even not giving , the unredacted documents requested by congress .
an embarrassment to our country !
only fools , or worse , are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon .
they lose a fortune , and this will be changed .
also , our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country ... not a level playing field !
so funny to watch fake news networks , among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with , criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased .
sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc , which is a total joke .
mexico is making a fortune on nafta ... they have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic .
with all of the money they make from the u . s . , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours , at least until congress changes our immigration laws !
daca is dead because the democrats didn  t care or act , and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon ... no longer works .
must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation .
democrats want no borders , hence drugs and crime !
... congress must immediately pass border legislation , use nuclear option if necessary , to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people .
border patrol agents ( and ice ) are great , but the weak dem laws don  t allow them to do their job .
act now congress , our country is being stolen !
mexico has the absolute power not to let these large  caravans  of people enter their country .
they must stop them at their northern border , which they can do because their border laws work , not allow them to pass through into our country , which has no effective border laws ...
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca .
they want in on the act !
mexico is doing very little , if not nothing , at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border , and then into the u . s .
they laugh at our dumb immigration laws .
they must stop the big drug and people flows , or i will stop their cash cow , nafta .
border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal ( democrat ) laws like catch & release .
getting more dangerous .
 caravans  coming .
republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now .
no more daca deal !
governor jerry  moonbeam  brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include ( 1 ) kidnapping and robbery ( 2 ) badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize ( 3 ) dealing drugs .
is this really what the great people of california want ?
... does not include the fake washington post , which is used as a  lobbyist  and should so register .
if the p . o .
 increased its parcel rates , amazon  s shipping costs would rise by $ 2.6 billion .  this post office scam must stop .
amazon must pay real costs ( and taxes ) now !
while we are on the subject , it is reported that the u . s . post office will lose $ 1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon .
that amounts to billions of dollars .
the failing n . y . times reports that  the size of the company  s lobbying staff has ballooned ,  and that ...
washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair .
it's time to rebuild , and we will do it with american workers , american grit , and american pride !
jobs , jobs , jobs !
unemployment claims have fallen to a 45 - year low .
together , we are making the economy great again !
we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure , and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio .
a tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site , where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined !
i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election .
unlike others , they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments , use our postal system as their delivery boy ( causing tremendous loss to the u . s . ) , and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business !
... in the interim , hon .
robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary .
i am thankful for dr . david shulkin  s service to our country and to our great veterans !
i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l . jackson , md , as the new secretary of veterans affairs ...
great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall !

all citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders .
my administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in orange county defending their rights against california's illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies .

HDL just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus !
a great deal for american and korean workers .
let  s now focus on our important security relationship .
received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me .
in the meantime , and unfortunately , maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost !
for years and through many administrations , everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility .
now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity .
look forward to our meeting !
the second amendment will never be repealed !
as much as democrats would like to see this happen , and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens , no way .
we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court !
i am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the president's park in april .
i encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic .

trade talks going on with numerous countries that , for many years , have not treated the united states fairly .
in the end , all will be happy !
so much fake news .
never been more voluminous or more inaccurate .
but through it all , our country is doing great !
the economy is looking really good .
it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers .
the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better .
HDL just wrote a book which everyone is talking about .
he was a great help .
he is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in nh and beyond .
he calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times .

happy national #medalofhonorday to our heroes .
we love you !
... lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed ( if for no other reason than they can bill more ) , which is unfair to our great country - and i am very happy with my existing team .
besides , there was no collusion with russia , except by crooked hillary and the dems !
many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia case ... don  t believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on .
fame & fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer , though some are conflicted .
problem is that a new ...
much can be done with the $ 1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall .
it is just a down payment .
work will start immediately .
the rest of the money will come - and remember daca , the democrats abandoned you ( but we will not ) !
because of the $ 700 & $ 716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military , many jobs are created and our military is again rich .
building a great border wall , with drugs ( poison ) and enemy combatants pouring into our country , is all about national defense .
build wall through m !
france honors a great hero .

so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism .
even stronger measures needed , especially at borders !

we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support .
we are with you HDL !
as a matter of national security i've signed the omnibus spending bill .
i say to congress : i will never sign another bill like this again .
to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again , i'm calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills !
obama administration legalized bump stocks .
as i promised , today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period .
we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns .
news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill .
1:00 p . m .
i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats ( not even mentioned in bill ) and the border wall , which is desperately needed for our national defense , is not fully funded .
daca was abandoned by the democrats .
very unfair to them !
would have been tied to desperately needed wall .
house intelligence committee votes to release final report .
findings : ( 1 ) no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign & russia .
( 2 ) the obama administrations post election response was insufficient .
( 3 ) clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts .
i am pleased to announce that , effective 4/9 / 18 , HDL will be my new national security advisor .
i am very thankful for the service of general h . r .
mcmaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend .
there will be an official contact handover on 4/9 .
my honor charlie - thank you !
as a candidate , i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade , protect american workers , and defend our national security .
today , we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment .

remember when they were saying , during the campaign , that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds , but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary  s large and highly sophisticated staff .
